Algorithm 


Add a toggle to control if currencies not supported in the US should be displayed.

Idea: 
Hide, Show and Toggle  ... Ultimately create a toggle switch

Show or hide currencies not support 
in the US

Toggle switch:
if they are not support in the US, then do not show


Otherwise, show them


Toggle button must know if the key: "isSupportedInUS" values is "true" or "false"
before it can make a decision to show or hide when the user selects 

Use should have the option to toggle currencies not support in the US.
